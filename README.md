# Flow-Routing
This repositiory contains a custom-developed model that simulates the flow of a river using numerical methods. The underlying hydrodynamics behavior is analyzed and solved numerically through the finite difference method (FDM). A tailored MATLAB script was created to implement the solution, enabling efficient computation and visualization.
